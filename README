ActiveTwitter
=============

A Twitter API client based on ActiveResource.  ActiveTwitter attempts to provide a more REST-like
interface to the actual Twitter API, while also providing fun syntax for common methods.

For example:

  ActiveTwitter.my.tweets


ActiveTwitter is a work in progress.  It may not do what you want or expect.
